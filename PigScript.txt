1)The average age of male and female persons died in the titanic tragedy:-

titanic = load '/user/acadgild/TitanicData.txt' using PigStorage(',') as 
(Passengerid:int, Survived:int, Pclass:int, Name, Sex:chararray, Age:int, Sibsp:int, Parch:int, Ticket:chararray, Fare:float, Cabin:chararray, Embarked:chararray);

filtitanic = filter titanic by Survived == 1;

male = filter filtitanic by Sex == 'male';

female = filter filtitanic by Sex == 'female';

grpmale = group male all;

grpfemale = group female all;

avgmale = foreach grpmale generate AVG(male.age);

avgfemale = foreach grpfemale generate AVG(female.age);

dump avgmale;  

dump avgfemale;


2)The number of people died and survived in each class:-

titanic = load '/user/acadgild/TitanicData.txt' using PigStorage(',') as 
(Passengerid:int,Survived:int, Pclass:int, Name, Sex:chararray, Age:int, Sibsp:int, Parch:int, Ticket:chararray, Fare:float, Cabin:chararray, Embarked:chararray);

dead = filter titanic by Survived == 0;

survived = filter titanic by Survived == 1;

grpdead = group dead by Pclass;

grpsurvived = group survived by Pclass;

outputdead = foreach grpdead generate COUNT(dead);

outputsurvived = foreach grpsurvived generate COUNT(survived);

dump outputdead;  

dump outputsurvived;
